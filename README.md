This is a collection of random script fragments I have created while playing with [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/) source code.

There's no guarantee that any script here is even working, and in case it appears to work, there's no guarantee that it does whatever you think it would do.

This repository is put in **PUBLIC DOMAIN**, so if you find anything interesting here, feel free to copy it.

(But then again, there is **ABSOLUTELY NO GUARANTEE** that it would do anything you want.  You're on your own.)
